    "\n",
    "Most people know the rules of personal finance:\n",
    "- Save regularly\n",
    "- Avoid impulse purchases  \n",
    "- Stick to a budget\n",
    "\n",
    "**But in reality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📱 Food delivery becomes the \"exception\" that happens 5x/week\n",
    "- 💸 SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) get skipped month after month\n",
    "- 📊 Budgets are created once and never revisited\n",
    "- 😰 Emotional triggers (stress, boredom, FOMO) override financial plans\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Traditional Apps Fail\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional finance apps track transactions and show pretty charts, but they **don't change behavior**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ❌ They show *what* happened, not *why*\n",
    "- ❌ They don't explain patterns or triggers\n",
    "- ❌ They don't provide personalized coaching\n",
    "- ❌ They lack memory and context across interactions\n",

    "✨ Suggested Actions:\n",
    "1. Identify your stress trigger earlier in the day\n",

    "3. Replace the reward: Call a friend instead of ordering\n",

    "### How to Evaluate HabitLedger\n",
    "\n",
    "When assessing the agent's performance, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Principle Detection Accuracy**\n",
    "- Does the agent correctly identify the underlying behavioural principle?\n",
    "- Are the detected triggers relevant to the user's input?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Intervention Relevance**\n",
    "- Are the suggested interventions actionable and specific?\n",
    "- Do they align with the detected principle and user's goals?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Memory & Consistency**\n",
    "- Does the agent remember goals, streaks, and struggles across interactions?\n",
    "- Does it reference past context appropriately?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Response Quality**\n",
    "- Is the tone supportive and non-judgmental?\n",
    "- Are explanations clear and grounded in behavioural science?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Multi-Step Behavior**\n",
    "- Does the agent show adaptive behavior over multiple interactions?\n",
    "- Does it recognize patterns and adjust recommendations?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keyword-based detection**: Not yet using LLM for nuanced pattern recognition\n",
    "- **No real-time data**: Memory persists within session but doesn't integrate with actual financial data\n",
    "- **Limited context**: Doesn't yet maintain conversation history beyond memory fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate LLM-based principle detection for better accuracy\n",
    "- Add visualizations for streak tracking and progress monitoring\n",
    "- Implement session summaries and weekly reviews\n",
    "- Connect to financial APIs for real-time habit tracking"

    "### Evaluation Metrics Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "The table above shows results from running the agent on diverse test scenarios. Here's how to interpret the metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Qualitative Metrics (Manual Assessment)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clarity**: Are the agent's responses clear and easy to understand?\n",
    "   - Check if principle names are explained\n",
    "   - Verify interventions are actionable and specific\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relevance**: Do detected principles match the user's actual issue?\n",
    "   - Compare the prompt to the detected principle\n",
    "   - Assess if interventions address the root cause\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tone**: Is the agent supportive and non-judgmental?\n",
    "   - Look for encouraging language\n",
    "   - Check that responses avoid blame or criticism\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automated Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Source Distribution**: Shows whether ADK (LLM) or keyword matching was used\n",
    "   - Higher ADK usage suggests more nuanced detection\n",
    "   - Keyword fallback ensures robustness\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Response Length**: Indicates level of detail in responses\n",
    "   - Typical range: 300-800 characters\n",
    "   - Too short may lack detail; too long may be overwhelming\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Processing Time**: Measures performance\n",
    "   - ADK calls are slower (~1-3s) but more accurate\n",
    "   - Keyword matching is faster (~0.1s) but less nuanced\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Coverage**: Percentage of scenarios where a principle was detected\n",
    "   - Target: >90% principle detection rate\n",
    "   - \"None\" detections indicate unclear input or gaps in coverage"
