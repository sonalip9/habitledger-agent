    "\n",
    "HabitLedger is an AI-powered behavioural money coach designed to help users build healthier financial habits through:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Behavioural Science Principles**: Uses proven concepts like loss aversion, habit loops, friction reduction, and commitment devices\n",
    "- **Personalized Interventions**: Suggests specific, actionable strategies tailored to your situation\n",
    "- **Memory & Tracking**: Remembers your goals, streaks, and struggles across interactions\n",
    "- **Adaptive Coaching**: Detects patterns and adjusts recommendations over time\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Notebook Demonstrates\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How the agent analyzes user input using keyword-based principle detection\n",
    "2. How it generates personalized coaching responses with interventions\n",
    "3. How memory tracks progress across multiple interactions\n",
    "4. Sample scenarios covering common financial habit challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This demo uses deterministic keyword matching (no LLM calls yet) to demonstrate the core agent architecture and behaviour analysis logic."

    "### How to Evaluate HabitLedger\n",
    "\n",
    "When assessing the agent's performance, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Principle Detection Accuracy**\n",
    "- Does the agent correctly identify the underlying behavioural principle?\n",
    "- Are the detected triggers relevant to the user's input?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Intervention Relevance**\n",
    "- Are the suggested interventions actionable and specific?\n",
    "- Do they align with the detected principle and user's goals?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Memory & Consistency**\n",
    "- Does the agent remember goals, streaks, and struggles across interactions?\n",
    "- Does it reference past context appropriately?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Response Quality**\n",
    "- Is the tone supportive and non-judgmental?\n",
    "- Are explanations clear and grounded in behavioural science?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Multi-Step Behavior**\n",
    "- Does the agent show adaptive behavior over multiple interactions?\n",
    "- Does it recognize patterns and adjust recommendations?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keyword-based detection**: Not yet using LLM for nuanced pattern recognition\n",
    "- **No real-time data**: Memory persists within session but doesn't integrate with actual financial data\n",
    "- **Limited context**: Doesn't yet maintain conversation history beyond memory fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate LLM-based principle detection for better accuracy\n",
    "- Add visualizations for streak tracking and progress monitoring\n",
    "- Implement session summaries and weekly reviews\n",
    "- Connect to financial APIs for real-time habit tracking"
